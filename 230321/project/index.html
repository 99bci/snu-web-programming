            Storyline: Barry Egan hates himself and hates his life. The only
            male among eight siblings, Barry is treated poorly by his
            overbearing sisters. Despite owning his own business, he has gotten
            nowhere in life largely because of his insecurities. He leads a
            solitary life, which allows him to hide his violent outbursts that
            occur when he's frustrated. His solitude however allows him to
            think, he stumbling upon a scheme to travel the world on a pittance,
            travel which he has never done. Concurrently, he meets two people
            who pull him in two different directions. The first is Lena Leonard,
            a friend of his sister Elizabeth. Barry is slow to realize that Lena
            is attracted to him, he making her make all the first moves. Lena is
            eventually able to get Barry out of his shell, she who sticks around
            despite his obvious problems. His burgeoning relationship and thus
            new life with Lena is threatened by the second, "Georgia", who he
            contacted in an effort to alleviate his loneliness. Georgia and her
            "band of brothers" do whatever they can get get out of Barry what
            they want, no matter the price to Barry.

            Storyline: Marc (Michel Piccoli) recruits Alex (Denis Lavant), son
            of his former, now dead colleague. Alex is a card shark with a big
            dream to go out to the world and leave his own mark. His
            determination leads him to break up with his girl friend, Lise
            (Julie Deply). Alex initially refuses to help Marc and Hans for
            their "job" of stealing the culture of new drug. But Anna (Juliette
            Binoche)'s charm and beauty were irresistible. Alex joins the
            elders. Alex's dance to David Bowie's Modern Love illustrates
            unfolding emotions of young Alex moving into an adult (graying if
            not dying) world. The interplay among the generations, between
            genders, among social classes, memory and hopes, all played against
            black and white and occasional red back drop. Anna's cobalt blue
            robe punctuates the moment when Alex confesses his love for her.

            Storyline: "2001" is a story of evolution. Sometime in the distant
            past, someone or something nudged evolution by placing a monolith on
            Earth (presumably elsewhere throughout the universe as well).
            Evolution then enabled humankind to reach the moon's surface, where
            yet another monolith is found, one that signals the monolith placers
            that humankind has evolved that far. Now mankind, assisted by
            artificial intelligence (such as HAL), must dare to encounter the
            monolith placers. If successful we will achieve the next step in
            evolution, whatever that may be.
